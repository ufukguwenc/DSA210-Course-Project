DSA210 Course Project

Project Description
This project involves analyzing data from Instagram to gain insights into personal usage habits, engagement levels, and audience interactions. The aim is to extract meaningful patterns and trends from the dataset, applying various data science methods. This initiative is part of the Introduction to Data Science course and emphasizes hands-on learning by working with real-world data.

Purpose and Motivation
Instagram is one of the most popular social platforms globally, offering a rich source of data on user activity and engagement. I selected this project to:
- Better understand my own activity patterns and audience interactions on Instagram.
- Discover how my content performs over time.
- Apply data science techniques to a practical dataset for skill-building.
- Create a portfolio project showcasing my analytical abilities and creativity.

Data Collection
The dataset was obtained using Instagram's **Download Your Information** feature, which provides user-specific data, including:
- Post timestamps and interaction details.
- Engagement statistics such as likes and comments.
- Follower growth and account relationships.

The raw data remains private, with only scripts and processed analyses shared in this project.

Key Project Components
1. **Exploratory Analysis:**
   - Assess posting habits, audience engagement, and interaction frequency.
   - Identify trends in content performance over time.
2. **Visual Representations:**
   - Design charts and graphs to display engagement statistics.
   - Highlight patterns in user behavior and audience responses.
3. **Machine Learning Applications:**
   - Build predictive models to estimate post performance based on features like hashtags and posting time.
   - Group similar posts based on engagement metrics using clustering techniques.
4. **Conclusions and Insights:**
   - Summarize findings on Instagram usage habits.
   - Propose actionable strategies to optimize future content.

Tools and Methods
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
- **Data Access:** Instagram's built-in data download service.
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for managing and sharing code.
- **Documentation:** Clear inline comments and markdown files to explain the project.

Deliverables
- A public repository with:
  - Code for data analysis and visualizations.
  - Summaries of findings.
  - A README file explaining the project details.
- Additional outputs like a brief video or web page presenting the results.
- Participation in peer-review sessions to evaluate and learn from others' projects.
